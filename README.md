# TP Todo App

This is my attempt to implement the project I'm assigning people for a skill assessment. See [instructions.md] for project instructions

## Notes

- haven't created a react app from scratch in some time
- have never had good success with `create-react-app`, but will try it again
- also haven't used redux beyond any tutorials or very small learning projects

## Timeline

- started 2019-03-18 18:55
- 19:20
    - had used create-react-app, plus a quick tutorial online, to create a react redux app hello world
    - tried to start it with `npm start`, babel-jest version error
    - tried reinstalling all the node_modules, didn't help
    - have sworn off `create-react-app`, like I have so many times before
    - using CDN scripts instead
    - and no JSX
    - and no CSS modules
- 19:35
    - thought I was good to go, just using react from cdn, but forgot I needed a UMD version
    - stupid React should just give us a damn ES6 module
- 19:48
    - back in action for real now
    - hello world app works
    - github repo created
- 19:51
    - using global jest cli test runner, in the spirit of keeping this project npm free, just because I can
    - set up a sample test to verify test runner works

## To Do

- unit tests
    - add jest
    - add tests for all requirements, including storage
- UI
    - add cosmos
    - build all UI components
- build app
- review requirements
