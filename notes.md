# TP Todo App
- haven't created a react app from scratch in some time
- also haven't used redux beyond any tutorials or very small learning projects
- started 2019-03-18 18:55

    - had used create-react-app, plus a quick tutorial online, to create a react redux app hello world
    - tried to start it with `npm start`, babel-jest version error
    - tried reinstalling all the node_modules, didn't help
    - have sworn off `create-react-app`, like I have so many times before
    - using CDN scripts instead
    - and no JSX
    - and no CSS modules

    - thought I was good to go, just using react from cdn, but forgot I needed a UMD version
    - stupid React should just give us a damn ES6 module
